# GPIBUtils-NG — Shared Project Memory

> Handoff/context for anyone — human or AI assistant — working on this repo. It mirrors the state of

## What this project is

A ground-up consolidation of ~18 individual GPIB/VISA instrument-control repositories (scattered across
[@TGoodhew](https://github.com/TGoodhew)'s account) into **one clean, testable .NET solution**. Each
existing instrument driver / app / utility that was found is tracked as its own **GitHub issue** in this
repo (one per instrument/driver). See the pinned **epic #44** for the full index, and `README.md` for
the target architecture.

## Locked decisions

| Decision | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language | **C#** | Primary language enforced via `.gitattributes` (bulk data vendored). |
| Target framework | **.NET Framework 4.7.2 (`net472`)** | All projects, including WPF. Matches the legacy source; minimizes VISA.NET friction. |
| VISA layer | Pluggable **provider model**; NI parts use the **official NI assemblies** | `NationalInstruments.Visa` + `Ivi.Visa` referenced by `HintPath` from the local NI-VISA install — **not** vendored, **not** the Kelary community NuGet (dropped), **not** the official NI NuGet (net6.0-only, unusable on net472). |
| UI split | **Console = Spectre.Console**, **Windows = WPF** | Core/drivers carry no UI dependency. WinForms sources migrate to WPF. |
| Reference architecture | The **`HP-Attenuator`** repo | Core lib + Ivi.Visa + simulator + CI — the pattern the rest converges on. |

## Solution layout & status

## Development workflow (no-hardware build policy)

Development happens **without the physical instruments**, so building and hardware verification are
decoupled. Full board: [`docs/HARDWARE_VERIFICATION.md`](docs/HARDWARE_VERIFICATION.md) (mirrored by pinned
HW-verification tracking issue **#46**); changes logged in [`CHANGE_LOG.md`](CHANGE_LOG.md).

- **`main`** = always-green integration line (builds + passes **Simulated**-provider tests). Everything stacks on it.
- Per issue: branch **`feat/<issue#>-<slug>`** → port driver + simulator + tests + CLI branch (#45).
- **Merge to `main` on simulator/unit-test green — HW verification is _not_ a merge gate** (lets the next driver build immediately).
- **Do not close the issue on merge.** Label it **`verification-needed`**, add the bench checklist, register it on the board, and tag the merge commit **`verify/<issue#>-<instrument>`**.
- At the bench: run the checklist against real HW, record pass/fail + FW/serial/date, **then** close (or open a follow-up on a discrepancy).

## Build & test

```
# .NET 10 SDK builds net472 via Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies (no full targeting pack needed)
dotnet build GPIBUtils-NG.sln
dotnet test  GPIBUtils-NG.sln

# Run the console (Simulated provider needs no hardware)
gpibutils providers
gpibutils idn   GPIB0::5::INSTR  --provider Simulated
gpibutils query GPIB0::14::INSTR "MEAS:VOLT?" --provider Simulated --engineering V
```

`GpibUtils.Visa.Ni` uses the real NI providers where NI-VISA is installed, and **builds an "NI-VISA
unavailable" stub otherwise** — so the whole solution (and CI) builds with zero NI setup; no need to
remove any project reference. Pass `-p:RequireNi=true` to hard-fail when NI is expected. NI DLLs are
**never committed** (they resolve from the install into `bin/`).

## Key conventions (apply to all future work)

- **Provider model** — drivers only see `IInstrumentSession`; the wire is an `IGpibProvider` selected
  via `GpibProviders` (default `NI-VISA`, override in code or `GPIBUTILS_GPIB_PROVIDER`). Add a vendor
  by creating `GpibUtils.Visa.<Vendor>` and registering it (or adding to the reflection-load list). Full
  guide: [`docs/implementing-a-gpib-provider.md`](docs/implementing-a-gpib-provider.md).
- **CLI-first (issue #45)** — every instrument must be fully operable from the command line via a
  hierarchical Spectre.Console.Cli tree (`gpibutils <device> <action>`) with self-documenting `--help`
  at **every** level; no interactive-only paths. Each migrated driver adds its own command branch plus
  the shared global options `--provider` / `--address` / `--timeout`.
- **Porting a driver** — no hardcoded GPIB addresses (make the resource configurable); move onto the
  shared transport; add a simulator/mock so it builds & tests without hardware; port/author tests;
  reconcile duplicate implementations into one canonical driver (see the "Related implementations" note
  in each issue).
- **Don't re-copy** `ToEngineeringFormat` — use `GpibUtils.Common`.
- **Bench uses HP-IB bus extenders (HP 37204A or similar)** — this has two hard consequences:
  1. **Bus-scan discovery is untrustworthy.** An extender ACKs the address handshake for its whole remote
     segment, so a VISA scan (`Rm.Find`) reports *every* GPIB address 0–30 as present — all phantom. Never
     use `discover` / the WPF Discover button to enumerate real instruments; drive by explicit resource
     string (`--address` / per-driver `DefaultResource`). Diagnostic: **seeing (nearly) every address in use
     means an extender is in the path** — both front-ends warn when `Discover` returns ≥15 resources.
  2. **SRQ / serial-poll must tolerate extender latency.** Keep timeouts generous and make the #43
     `Srq.Completion` engine forgiving of the longer, variable turnaround across the link. Directly affects
     the HP 8902A (SRQ-based measurement-complete handshake).

## Migration backlog map

- **#1** foundation · **#2–#43** one issue per instrument/driver found (42 items) · **#44** pinned epic ·
  **#45** the CLI hierarchical-help requirement.
- **Consolidate duplicates** (same instrument, multiple source repos): HP 8673B → #3/#8/#18/#23 (canonical
  = #8); HP 8902A → #2/#9/#24/#34 (canonical = #9, richest); HP 53131A → #5/#21; HP 34401A → #17/#36;
  Rigol DM3058 → #26 supersedes #30; HP 3325B → #28/#29; HP 8340A/B → #7/#16/#34; HP-GL plotters →
  #38/#39/#40 share #42's renderer; 85620A → #10/#14; SRQ handling → #43 replaces ad-hoc code. Details in #44.

## Current status / resume point

- **Foundation (#1) essentially complete:** core transport + Common + Console + **WPF shell** + **CI** all
  landed; `Hpgl`/`Mcp` scaffolded (filled by #42, #41); `Visa.Ni` degrades gracefully without NI so the
  whole solution builds with zero NI setup. **WPF visual smoke test passed** (2026-07-09) — #1 ready to close.
- **SRQ completion engine landed** (#43, 2026-07-10): `GpibUtils.Visa.Srq` — the shared, data-driven
  `CompletionWaiter` (SRQ-edge + direct-bit flows) driven by a `StatusModel`, decoupled via `IStatusChannel`
  with `SessionStatusChannel` bridging a live session. Headless-tested against a virtual-clock 8560 simulator.
  Defaults kept generous for HP-IB extender latency. It targets **SRQ-enable-mask-driven** completions
  (8560-style sweeps); instruments with their own settled-read handshake (the 8902A) keep theirs. CLI/MCP
  exposure deferred until the first mask-driven consumer.
- **HP 8902A Measuring Receiver landed** (#9, 2026-07-10): seeds `GpibUtils.Instruments.Meters`
  (`IMeasuringReceiver`) — the canonical 8902A. Tuned RF Level (dB) / RF power (dBm) / frequency, cal-factor
  tables, zero+sensor-cal, Track Mode, Avg/Sync detectors; settled-read Data-Ready serial-poll completion
  (hardware-verified inline — deliberately NOT rewired onto #43's engine before bench re-verification).
  `Hp8902ASimulatedDevice` + 21 tests; `gpibutils hp8902a init|preset|status|frequency|power|level`.
  Default address `GPIB0::14::INSTR` (8902A factory-default HP-IB address, confirmed). 🟡 awaiting HW.
- **Extender-aware discovery caveat landed** (2026-07-09): `gpibutils discover` and WPF Discover now warn
  when a scan returns ≥15 resources that an HP-IB bus extender is in the path and the list is phantom
  (see Key conventions).
- **Drivers landed** (all 🟡 awaiting HW, board / issue #46): HP 11713A (#6), HP 8340B (#7), HP 8673B (#8),
  HP 8902A (#9); tags `verify/6-hp11713a` / `verify/7-hp8340b` / `verify/8-hp8673b` / `verify/9-hp8902a`.
  **109 tests green.**
- **Next step:** next driver candidate — **HP 3499A switch #4** or an SCPI DMM (HP 34401A #17/#36); or
  flesh out `Hpgl` (#42) / `Mcp` (#41), or add instrument panels to the WPF shell. The measuring-receiver
  category (`Meters`) is now seeded for the power meters (#25, #33).
